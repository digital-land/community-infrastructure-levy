# Community infrastructure levy data

The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is a charge which can be levied by local authorities on new development. It only applies in areas where a local authority has consulted on and approved a charging schedule which sets out those charges

Data related to CIL is useful for a number of reasons, including:

* To know which planning authorities have opted into CIL.
* To know what stage an LPA is at with adopting their CIL charging schedule.
* To easily be able to find the CIL schedule (legal instrument).
* To be able to understand the CIL rates/levies in an area.
* To be able to calculate the amount of CIL payable for a development

As we find [more use cases for the data we will record on design.planning](https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/planning-consideration/community-infrastructure-levy/research/).

## Seeding data

The data design team in MHCLG have started to collect the CIL schedules published by local planning authorities. This source data is available from this repository and is published on planning.data.gov.uk.

Any questions or queries about the data please open an issue.
